# History Server

The history server (HS) is a software tracability system spanning source
code repository to executing artifact.

It provides a search engine and a SQL database with a highly granular
set of truth assertions about the software system state.

The HS will be particularly useful for companies operating
microservices.

## documentation

See docs/DESIGN.md to review what the HS is designed to do
